    David is a second-year student in the Interaction Design program at George Brown College. He drinks coffee daily and hopes to utilise his knowledge of all things IxD (including, but not limited to: information architecture, creating user flows, wireframing, low- and high-fidelity mockups, and Adobe Creative Cloud applications) to pursue a career as an Interaction Designer. He is passionate about designing with a strong foundation built upon innovation, accessibility, aesthetics, and the environment.
